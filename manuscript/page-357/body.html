But having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon Madame de Montbazon pass in her carriage, and still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman, he did not wish to be to her what he wished to be to Mazarin, and in the hope of seeing her again, had asked for a leaden comb, which was allowed him. The comb was to be a leaden one, because his beard, like that of most fair people, was rather red; he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing it.</p><p>As Grimaud entered he saw this comb on the tea-table; he took it up, and as he took it he made a low bow.</p><p>The duke looked at this strange figure with surprise. The figure put the comb in its pocket.</p></div> </div>
