Aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion; D’Artagnan, to be preparing his exordium. Each of them, when the other was not looking, hazarded a sly glance. It was Aramis who broke the silence.</p><p>“What are you thinking of, D’Artagnan?” he began.</p><p>“I was thinking, my dear old friend, that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church, and now that you are an abbe you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer.”</p><p>“‘Tis true; man, as you know,” said Aramis, “is a strange animal, made up of contradictions. Since I became an abbe I dream of nothing but battles.”</p><p>“That is apparent in your surroundings; you have rapiers here of every form and to suit the most exacting taste. Do you still fence well?”</p><p>“I—I fence as well as you did in the old time—better still, perhaps; I do nothing else all day.”</p></div> </div>
