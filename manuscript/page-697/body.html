It is eleven o’clock in the morning and the pious sisters have just finished saying mass for the success of the armies of King Charles I. Leaving the church, a woman and a young girl dressed in black, the one as a widow and the other as an orphan, have re-entered their cell.</p><p>The woman kneels on a prie-dieu of painted wood and at a short distance from her stands the young girl, leaning against a chair, weeping.</p><p>The woman must have once been handsome, but traces of sorrow have aged her. The young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her; the lady appears to be about forty years of age, the girl about fourteen.</p><p>“Oh, God!” prayed the kneeling suppliant, “protect my husband, guard my son, and take my wretched life instead!”</p><p>“Oh, God!” murmured the girl, “leave me my mother!”</p></div> </div>
