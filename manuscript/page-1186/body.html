It turned out as D’Artagnan had foreseen. The colonel neither had nor could have any suspicion.</p><p>They halted for the king to dine. This time, however, due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape. In the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers.</p><p>“Will you dine with me?” asked Harrison of D’Artagnan.</p><p>“Gad, I should be very happy, but I have my companion, Monsieur du Vallon, and the two prisoners, whom I cannot leave.
