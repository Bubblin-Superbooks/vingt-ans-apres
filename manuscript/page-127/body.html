He was thought to be dead; his wife, especially, who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow, stoutly maintained that death had taken him. Therefore, after the connection had continued three years, carefully fostered by D’Artagnan, who found his bed and his mistress more agreeable every year, each doing credit to the other, the mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and proposed to D’Artagnan that he should marry her.</p><p>“Ah, fie!” D’Artagnan replied. “Bigamy, my dear! Come now, you don’t really wish it?”</p><p>“But he is dead; I am sure of it.”</p><p>“He was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged.”</p></div> </div>
