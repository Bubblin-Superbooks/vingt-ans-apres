Instead of returning the ball to me when I call for it from the top of the wall, he throws me another; that other ball contains a letter. Thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do it.”</p><p>“The devil it does! The devil it does!” said La Ramee, scratching his head; “you are in the wrong to tell me that, my lord.
