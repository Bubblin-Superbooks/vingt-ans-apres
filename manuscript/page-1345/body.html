<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Look at my eyes and you will see what no looking-glass has ever shown you—a frank and honorable countenance.”</p><p>To this flow of words, not perhaps in the best taste, but characteristic of D’Artagnan, whose principal object was to divert his opponent’s attention, Mordaunt did not reply, but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with D’Artagnan.</p><p>He smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the Gascon anxious.</p><p>“Come, come,” cried D’Artagnan, “we must finish with this,” and in his turn he pressed Mordaunt hard, who continued to lose ground, but evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a moment. However, as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever, Mordaunt’s foot at last touched the wall, against which he rested his left hand.</p></div> </div>
