We shall not interfere with each other—your object is a title; mine, money. If I can get enough to rebuild Artagnan, which my ancestors, impoverished by the Crusades, allowed to fall into ruins, and to buy thirty acres of land about it, that is all I wish. I shall retire and die tranquilly—at home.”</p><p>“For my part,” said Porthos, “I desire to be made a baron.”</p><p>“You shall be one.”</p><p>“And have you not seen any of our other friends?”</p><p>“Yes, I have seen Aramis.”</p><p>“And what does he wish? To be a bishop?”</p><p>“Aramis,” answered D’Artagnan, who did not wish to undeceive Porthos, “Aramis, fancy, has become a monk and a Jesuit, and lives like a bear. My offers did not arouse him,—did not even tempt him.”</p></div> </div>
